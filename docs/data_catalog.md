# Data Catalog

Per `CLAUDE.md` rule 8: no new data source may be added without a row here, approved by the
maintainer.

These four sources are already in production use (predating this catalog); rows added here
during Block B (`config/sources/*.yaml`) formalize existing fetches, not new approvals. Licence
terms are marked TODO pending separate verification — flagged, not blocking, since nothing new
is being introduced.

## `statbel_geography` — reference geography

Added in Block C. This is **reference data, not an observation source**: it populates
`geographies` (the country, 3 regions, 10 provinces, 43 arrondissements, 565 communes, and 55
historical predecessor communes) and carries no indicator values.

Files, downloaded by the maintainer on 2026-09-05 and held under `data/raw/statbel/`
(gitignored — see `docs/features/geography.md`):

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `Nis9_Nis6_refnis_names_01012026.xlsx` | Statistical sectors with the full explicit hierarchy and NUTS codes, valid 2026-01-01 |
| `REFNIS_DEFINITIEF.csv` | Administrative entities, pre-2019 (589 communes) |
| `REFNIS_2019.csv` | Administrative entities, post-2019 wave (581 communes) |
| `REFNIS_2025.csv` | Administrative entities, post-2025 wave (565 communes) |
| `Conversion Postal code_Refnis code_va01012025.xlsx` | Postal code → commune; retained, not yet used |

**Licence is unverified.** Statbel open data is generally published for reuse, but the specific
terms and attribution requirement have not been read and recorded — and this platform is
intended to be sold, where "I think it was open data" is not a defensible position. The
maintainer must confirm the licence name, URL and reuse conditions here before any figure
derived from this geography is republished commercially.
